# Key relationships
relationships:
  - "warehouses.warehouse_code -> inventory.warehouse_id"
  - "warehouses.warehouse_code -> sales.warehouse_id"
  - "skus.sku_id -> inventory.sku_id"
  - "skus.sku_id -> sales.sku_id"

# Sales Velocity Analysis
velocity_concepts:
  daily_velocity: "Average units sold per day = Total quantity sold / Number of days in period"
  monthly_velocity: "Average units sold per month = Total quantity sold / Number of months in period"
  stock_cover: "Days of stock remaining = Current inventory / Daily velocity"
  calculation_methods:
    - "Period-based: Uses total days/months in analysis period (includes zero-sale days)"
    - "Active-based: Uses only days/months with actual sales"
